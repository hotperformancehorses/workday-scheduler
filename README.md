Module Five Challenge - Third Party APIs

Develop a user-friendly calendar application that enables users to save events for each hour of a standard working day (9am-5pm). This browser-based app will incorporate dynamic updates to the HTML and CSS using jQuery. While the initial code employs the Day.js library for date and time operations, you have the flexibility to choose an alternative JavaScript solution for this purpose.
